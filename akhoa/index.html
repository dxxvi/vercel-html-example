    <p>Dec 23 - 26 stay in Seacaucus, NJ</p>
    <img src="Dec-23-26-Seacaucus-hotel.png">
    <p>From Seacaucus, NJ to New York Penn Station (about 7 blocks away from Times Square): take <a href="https://www.njtransit.com/">NJ transit train. Ticket $5/person one way.</a><br>

    </p>
    <p>Parking at Seacaucus train station: too expensive. It's better to take Uber from hotel to train station. <img src="parking-seacaucus-train-station.png"></p>
    <p>Toll fee from NJ to NYC is less than $20. It's free from NYC back to NJ (remember to set no toll in Google Maps) <img src="NJ-NYC-toll.png"></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.bestparking.com/new-york-ny-parking/neighborhoods/new-york-city-parking/">Parking in NYC</a>: from $20 - $50/day (bestparking also has a phone app to book and pay for parking) <img src="parking-nyc.png"></p>
    <p>So, taking trains to NYC for 5 people costs: ($15 Uber + $5 train ticket * 5) * 2 ways = $80 and we need to go to the train station on time or we'll miss the train (which runs every hour or maybe more often)</p>
    <p>Driving to NYC and park there: $10 gas + $20 toll + $40 (most of the times we can find a place that charges $30) = $70. We can go to and leave NYC whenever we like, no need to look at the watch.</p>
    <p>Staying in DC area: it's not a bad idea to stay arround Falls Church, VA: not very far from DC, a lot of Vietnamese foods and there is Eden Center which is like a small Cho Ben Thanh. <img src="VA-hotels.png"></p>
    <p>Parking in DC: use the Best Parking app above, it costs about $20 - $30/day.</p>
